# Data Analysis Projects 📊

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **data analysis projects** using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
Each project demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and probability/statistical concepts**.  

The goal is to showcase **real-world data analysis techniques** for learning, freelancing, and internship/job opportunities.  
## 🚀 Projects Included
1. **Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢**  
   - Explores the Titanic dataset to analyze survival chances based on gender, class, age, and fare.  
   - Compares empirical vs theoretical probabilities.  
   - Includes data visualization and key insights.  

*(More projects will be added soon...)*
